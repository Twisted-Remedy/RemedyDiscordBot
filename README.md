My own discord bot as an example of a project.

```
# [Config.json](config.json)
- Go to [Discord Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new application then, inside that application go to the "Bot" on the left side reset and copy the token. **(DON'T SHARE WITH ANYONE)**
- (Optional) If you want to have the bot only accessible in specific discord servers copy the id of those servers and add into "guild_ids" array.
- Go to [Riot Developers](https://developer.riotgames.com/) register a product with any "Product Name", "Product Description" of your choice, you can leave "Product Group" default and make sure "Product Game Focus" is "League Of Legends".
